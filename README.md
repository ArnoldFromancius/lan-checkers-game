# LAN Checkers (Draughts)

A simple but functional Checkers (Draughts) game for Linux, featuring two gameplay modes:

- 🧠 Single-player vs CPU  
- 🌐 LAN Multiplayer (host or connect to a game on the same network)  

> ⚠️ This release targets **Linux only**. Windows support is planned for the next release.

The game follows classic International Draughts rules, including pawn promotion to kings and multi-jump captures. Turns alternate between players with clear visual indication. In LAN mode, one player hosts and sees their local IP; the second player connects using that IP — both must be on the same network.
